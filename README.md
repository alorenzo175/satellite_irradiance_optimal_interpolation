This code was used to perform optimal interpolation of satellite derived
and ground sensor data to produce better irradiance nowcasts. It was used
to produce the analysis in the paper ["Optimal Interpolation of Satellite
and Ground Data for Irradiance Nowcasting at City Scales](). The data is
available separately at []().

I recommend using [sumatra](http://sumatra.readthedocs.io) to keep track of
simulations. All parameters for OI can be specified in a parameter YAML file
and tracked by sumatra.
